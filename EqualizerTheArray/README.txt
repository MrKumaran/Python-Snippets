EqualizeTheArray

To find the minimum elements to be deleted inorder
to get the remaining element in the array are equal

for instance
case 1:
Let array = [1, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]

two elements are equal in array 4

now need to find the minimum number of element to be deleted.
So, that remaining two element are 4's
In this case minimum number of element to be deleted is 6

case 2:
Let array = [1, 2, 3]

All elements are distinct. So, it's simple.
length of array - (length of array -1)
in other terms keep one element and delete remaining
In this case minimum number of element to be deleted is 2
