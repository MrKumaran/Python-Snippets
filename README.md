## Python Snippets
- This repository contains a diverse collection of Python scripts developed for ad-hoc tasks, experimental coding, and quick problem-solving needs, showcasing various techniques and solutions.
  
  ### Why python?
  ##### Python has vast libraries, more built in methods which makes it easy to script and not to mention it's english alike.

### Naming Conventions I use:
- For Folders - Pascal case (First letter of each word is capitalized) eg: FirstName
- For files - Camel case (First word is all lowercase and all other word first letter is capitalized) eg: firstName
- For variables, method/function, class - Camel case
