## Python Snippets
- This repository contains a diverse collection of Python scripts developed for ad-hoc tasks, experimental coding, and quick problem-solving needs, showcasing various techniques and solutions.
  
  ### Why python?
  ##### Python has vast libraries, more built in methods which makes it easy to script and not to mention it's english alike.

##### So far
      - Exploring -> contain jupyter Notebook for it's interactive version to try various things in python
      - GeneratorCode -> contain code that will generate something(mostly string)
      - IceCream(Debugger) -> debugger module testing
      - ImageCompressor -> used to compress image in some format
      - PlayGround -> contain .py script of python code for various task
      - ProblemSolving -> contain code to solve specific problem statement
      - PythonGUI -> contain samples and test code for GUI in python(tkinter)
      - StringFormat -> various method for using string(format)
      - TCS -> solution for TCS codevitia

### Naming Conventions I use:
- For Folders - Pascal case (First letter of each word is capitalized) eg: FirstName
- For files - Camel case (First word is all lowercase and all other word first letter is capitalized) eg: firstName
- For variables, method/function, class - Camel case
