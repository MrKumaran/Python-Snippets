Need to return number of consective 1's occurs in a given binary string

for this, simple algorithm used is

checkes by each character in string
                if equals to 0
                    restart the counter
                else
                    find max between conter variable and max consective 1's variable
                    and store it in consective 1's variable we are not going change this variable
                then finally return consective 1's variable
